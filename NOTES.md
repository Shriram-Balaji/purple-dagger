# NOTES

## WHY THIS PROJECT?

This [amazing article](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/the-importance-of-side-projects-cf9f63954031) about taking up a side project.

## THINGS TO REMEMBER

### I keep asking myself this - How do I find a project to tackle that has not already been tackled ?

Doing something original isn’t a requirement. You’re not trying to start the next unicorn company. You’re just trying to build skills. So, if you see something that inspires you, and you’d like to try your hand at doing something similar, go for it. You’re bound to come up with a few interesting and original variations in the process, but moreover, you’ll be learning how to create the types of things you
appreciate.

## PROCEDURE

### Setting up a Development Environment for a React App

## Packages

- Webpack, webpack-dev-server [for live-reloading]
- babel-core,  babel-loader,  babel-preset-es2015,  babel-polyfill [A polyfill is used in order to make some features backwards compatible to older browsers]

## How to Start the server

 `npm install`
 
 `npm run start`
