# NOTES

## WHY THIS PROJECT?

This isnt working, this isnt driving me to complete as it actually should.

## THINGS TO REMEMBER

### I keep asking myself this - How do I find a project to tackle that has not already been tackled ?

WRONG. doing something original makes you want to continue to learn. this is now not that exciting as it should be to do a project. The increase in maturity of code should also mean that we dont keep repeating what we did.

## PROCEDURE

### Setting up a Development Environment for a React App

## Packages

- Webpack, webpack-dev-server [for live-reloading]
- babel-core,  babel-loader,  babel-preset-es2015,  babel-polyfill [A polyfill is used in order to make some features backwards compatible to older browsers]

## How to Start the server

 `npm install`

 `npm run start`

## IDEAS

Back to square one.

## CONTENT

Building a news hub seems more stupider than ever. I agree about the originality and stuff, but this doesnt drive me anymore
